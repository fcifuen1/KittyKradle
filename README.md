# KittyKradle
An Android app to simulate cat adoption from a pet shelter.

**Description:** This project is titled Kitty Kradle, a cat adoption application to help users connect with an animal adoption agency nearby to adopt the cat they want. The users will be able to make an account that will allow them to view and save any cats they like from their search. Once they have found a specific cat they like to adopt, a contact request would be sent to the agency that the cat is from.
